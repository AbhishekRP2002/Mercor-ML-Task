Based on the information provided, it is not possible to accurately calculate the technical complexity score for the codebase. However, based on the information provided, it is likely that the codebase is on the simpler side. Factors such as the size of the codebase, the modularity and structure, the technologies and libraries used, the number of dependencies, and the code quality all suggest that the codebase is fairly straightforward and not overly complex. Therefore, it is likely that the technical complexity score of the codebase is somewhere in the range of 3.0-4.0 out of 5.0."

This codebase is for a Flutter project called maize_app. Based on the size of the codebase, the modularity, the technologies used, the dependencies, the code quality, and the testing, I would assign a technical complexity score of 4.2/5. Analysis: The codebase is relatively large, making it more complex. The structure is modular, which helps reduce complexity. The technologies used are Flutter, C++, and CMake, which are all relatively easy to understand. The number of dependencies is small, and the code quality is good, as evidenced by the presence of comments and adherence to coding standards. The automated tests also help to reduce complexity."

I don't have enough information to accurately predict the technical complexity score of the codebase. However, based on the factors discussed and my own reasoning, I would assign a score of 3/5, as the codebase seems to have some structure and modularity, but it is unclear which technologies and libraries are being used. Additionally, the code quality, testing and dependencies may also be impacting the complexity of the project."
3,spell-checker-flask,https://github.com/solocldev/spell-checker-flask," The main functionality of this codebase is to provide a simple JSON response. The technical complexity score of the codebase is 3.5 out of 5. This score is based on the size of the codebase, the technologies and libraries used, the number and complexity of the dependencies, the code quality, and the presence and quality of automated tests. The score is lower because the codebase is relatively small and uses a limited number of technologies and libraries."
4,Spell-Checker-node,https://github.com/solocldev/Spell-Checker-node," The main functionality of this codebase is to create an API server that connects to a MongoDB database. It also provides endpoints for retrieving objects, adding logs, and performing demos. Based on the metrics and factors listed, I can calculate a technical complexity score of 3.8/5. Analysis: The codebase is fairly small and is well-structured and modular with a clear separation of concerns. It uses technologies with minimal learning curves and the dependencies are also relatively simple. The code quality is also relatively good."
